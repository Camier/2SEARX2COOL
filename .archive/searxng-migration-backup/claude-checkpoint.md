# Claude Desktop Checkpoint: Post-Docker Removal & SearXNG Migration

## System State Summary

**Date:** June 14, 2025  
**System:** WSL2 Ubuntu 22.04 on Windows  
**Major Operation:** Complete Docker removal and SearXNG migration preparation  
**User:** mik  

## Project Context: SearXNG-Convivial

**Project Overview:** A privacy-focused search engine platform with custom authentication, API access, and beautiful theming.

**Why We Migrated from Docker to Python:**
1. **Debugging Complexity:** 11 containers made troubleshooting extremely difficult
2. **Resource Overhead:** Docker consumed significant system resources
3. **Development Friction:** Container rebuilds slowed iteration cycles
4. **Maintenance Burden:** Docker Compose orchestration became unwieldy
5. **Direct Control Needed:** Python provides better debugging and customization

**Project Evolution Timeline:**
- Started as basic SearXNG Docker deployment
- Added Flask-based authentication layer
- Integrated API service for programmatic access
- Implemented WebSocket for real-time features
- Customized with Nichijou anime-styled theme
- Now migrating to native Python for sustainability

## Current System Configuration

### DOCKER: COMPLETELY REMOVED

- All 11 containers stopped and removed
- All images purged (freed 429MB+ space)
- 40+ volumes removed
- Docker CE packages completely uninstalled
- Status: docker command not found

### SEARXNG: MIGRATION DATA PRESERVED

**Backup Location:** ~/searxng-migration-backup/

**Previous Docker Architecture:**
- searxng-auth-proxy (port 8095) - Main entry
- searxng-convivial (port 8080) - Core service
- searxng-auth (port 5000) - Auth service
- searxng-api (port 5001) - API service
- searxng-websocket (port 3000) - WebSocket
- PostgreSQL, Redis, MinIO - Data stores

**Preserved Assets:**
- Nichijou theme (in themes-backup/)
- Complete settings.yml
- Custom templates preserved
- All environment variables documented
- Redis cache data saved

### PYTHON ENVIRONMENT: READY

- Python Version: 3.10.6 with development tools
- Redis: Running on port 6380 (native)
- Nginx: Configured and ready
- Setup Script: ~/projects/searxng-python/setup-searxng-python.sh
- PostgreSQL: Not installed (needs installation)

### OUTSTANDING ISSUES

1. Windows Port Proxies still active (need admin removal)
2. PostgreSQL Service not found, needs installation
3. WSL2 Restart recommended for complete network cleanup

## Important File Locations

~/searxng-migration-backup/
~/projects/searxng-python/

## Next Steps Checklist

- [ ] Install PostgreSQL
- [ ] Remove Windows port proxies (admin required)
- [ ] Restart WSL2
- [ ] Run setup-searxng-python.sh
- [ ] Verify Nichijou theme integration
- [ ] Set up authentication service
- [ ] Configure API endpoints
- [ ] Test WebSocket functionality
