# Introduction Prompt for New Claude Session

Hi Claude! I need context about the SearXNG-Convivial project migration.

## QUICK CONTEXT:

- **Previous:** 11 Docker containers (too complex to maintain)
- **Current:** Docker completely removed, migrating to native Python
- **Preserved:** All configs, theme, and data in ~/searxng-migration-backup/

## CHECKPOINT DOCUMENTS:
Please read these two files for complete context:
1. **System State:** 
2. **Full Context:** 

## CURRENT TASK:
[Your specific request here]

Please start by reading both checkpoint documents to understand the full migration context.
