### What We Have Now:
- **Single Directory**: `2SEARX2COOL/` containing the complete music search platform
- **Size**: 1.7MB (down from 2.5GB spread across multiple directories)
- **Space Freed**: ~2.5GB of redundant backups and duplicates removed

### Architecture Preserved:
```
2SEARX2COOL/
├── orchestrator/      # Flask app with WebSocket support (10k+ connections)
├── engines/           # 27 custom music search engines
├── music/             # Music-specific infrastructure
├── config/            # All configuration files

```

### Key Features:
- **Multi-tier Architecture**: nginx → Flask → SearXNG → Engines
