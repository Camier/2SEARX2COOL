## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. **SearXNG Engine Failures**
When tested directly against SearXNG (port 8888):
- Bandcamp: "unexpected crash"
- Soundcloud: "unexpected crash"  
- Genius: "unexpected crash"
- Mixcloud: "unexpected crash"
- Discogs: No results (silent failure)
- Jamendo: No results (silent failure)

### 2. **Mock Data Source**
All engines return identical results including:
- Radio stations (not actual music tracks)
- Same 35 results regardless of query or engine
- Results have proper structure but wrong content

### 3. **Architecture Issues**
```
Client → Orchestrator (8889) → SearXNG (8888) → Music Engines
                                                      ↓
                                                   FAILURE
                                                      ↓
                                            Fallback/Mock Data
```

## Identical Results Pattern

All engines return the same radio stations:
1. adr.fm - Electronic Dance Experience
2. Adroit Jazz Underground HD Opus
3. ROCK FM
4. # 100 GREATEST JAZZ LOUNGE BAR
... (31 more identical results)

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Fix SearXNG Music Engines**: Debug why engines crash in SearXNG
2. **Remove Mock Data**: Find and remove the source of identical results
3. **Add Engine Health Checks**: Implement proper error handling

### Investigation Required:
1. Check SearXNG engine implementations for missing dependencies
2. Verify API keys/authentication for engines that require them
3. Test engines in isolation to identify specific failures
4. Review SearXNG logs for detailed error messages

## Conclusion

The music search functionality is completely non-functional. All engines return identical mock/fallback data instead of real search results. The issue originates in the SearXNG layer where music engines are either crashing or failing silently. This needs to be addressed at the SearXNG configuration/implementation level before the orchestrator API can function properly.
