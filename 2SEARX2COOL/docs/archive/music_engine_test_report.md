# Music Engine Test Report for SearXNG-Cool

## Test Date: 2025-06-18

## Summary

All music engines in the SearXNG-Cool project are currently returning **identical results**, which indicates that the music search functionality is not properly connected to the actual SearXNG engine backends. 

## Key Findings

### 1. **All Engines Return Identical Results**
- Every music engine tested returns the exact same results for all queries
- Results appear to be from a fallback or mock data source
- No engine-specific results are being retrieved

### 2. **Engines Tested**
The following engines were tested with queries: "electronic", "jazz", "rock", "test"
- discogs music
- jamendo music  
- soundcloud
- bandcamp
- genius lyrics
- youtube music
- soundcloud enhanced
- bandcamp enhanced
- mixcloud
- mixcloud enhanced
- radio paradise

### 3. **API Architecture Issue**
- The music API endpoint (`/api/music/search`) is running on port 8889
- The MusicSearchService attempts to query SearXNG on port 8888
- However, the SearXNG instance on port 8888 reports all music engines as "unresponsive" or experiencing "unexpected crash"

### 4. **Sample Results (Identical Across All Engines)**
All engines return the same set of results, including:
- "adr.fm - Electronic Dance Experience" 
- "Adroit Jazz Underground HD Opus"
- "ROCK FM"
- "# 100 GREATEST JAZZ LOUNGE BAR"

These appear to be radio stations rather than music tracks from the intended sources.

## Technical Analysis

### Current Flow:
1. Client → Port 8889 (Flask Orchestrator) → `/api/music/search`
2. MusicSearchService → Port 8888 (SearXNG) → `/search?engines={engine}`
3. SearXNG returns error or fallback data
4. All engines get same results

### Issues Identified:
1. **SearXNG Music Engines Not Working**: The actual SearXNG instance reports music engines as unresponsive
2. **No Engine Differentiation**: Results are not being properly filtered by engine
3. **Missing Integration**: The connection between the orchestrator and SearXNG music engines is broken

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Debug SearXNG Music Engines**: Check why all music engines report "unexpected crash" in SearXNG
2. **Verify Engine Configuration**: Ensure music engines are properly configured in SearXNG settings
3. **Check API Keys**: Some engines may require API keys (Discogs, Genius, etc.)
4. **Test Direct SearXNG**: Test music engines directly through SearXNG interface

### Long-term Solutions:
1. **Implement Engine Health Monitoring**: Add endpoint to check individual engine status
2. **Add Fallback Handling**: Properly handle failed engines instead of returning mock data
3. **Engine-Specific Configuration**: Some engines may need specific settings or authentication
4. **Separate Test Suite**: Create dedicated tests for each music engine

## Test Data Location

All test results are saved in:
- `/home/mik/SEARXNG/searxng-cool/music_engine_results/`
- Summary: `music_engine_results/summary.txt`
- Individual results: `music_engine_results/{engine}_{query}.json`

## Conclusion

The music search functionality is currently non-functional due to all engines returning identical fallback data. The core issue appears to be with the SearXNG music engine implementations rather than the orchestrator API layer. Further investigation of the SearXNG configuration and engine implementations is required to restore proper functionality.
