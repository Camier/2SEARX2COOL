## Summary

### What Happened:
1. All engines we implemented ARE in the settings.yml
2. They were all properly configured and enabled
3. The issue was that we were looking in the wrong place initially
4. After copying engine files to `/usr/local/searxng/searxng-src/searx/engines/`, everything works

### Current Status:
- **15+ working music engines** returning actual results
- **8 engines** enabled but not returning results (due to site changes or anti-bot measures)
- **All engines properly configured** in settings.yml

### Key Locations:
- Settings: `/usr/local/searxng/searxng-src/searx/settings.yml`
- Engines: `/usr/local/searxng/searxng-src/searx/engines/`
- Your dev: `/home/mik/SEARXNG/searxng-cool/searxng-core/searxng-core/`

## Testing All Engines

```bash
# Test all music engines
python3 test_all_music_engines.py

# Test specific engine
curl "http://localhost:8888/search?q=test&engines=ENGINE_NAME&format=json" | jq '.results | length'

# List all music engines
curl "http://localhost:8888/config" | jq -r '.engines[] | select(.categories | contains(["music"])) | .name'
```

## Conclusion

Your SearXNG instance has one of the most comprehensive collections of music search engines available! With 15+ working engines including Last.fm, MusicBrainz, Discogs, Jamendo, and more, you have excellent coverage across:
- Commercial platforms (Deezer, YouTube)
- Independent music (Bandcamp, SoundCloud, Jamendo)
- Music databases (MusicBrainz, Discogs)
- Free/CC music (Free Music Archive, WikiCommons)
- Lyrics and info (Genius)

The engines that don't return results are mostly due to modern anti-bot protections that are difficult to bypass without using official APIs.
