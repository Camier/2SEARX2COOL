## 🔌 IPC Architecture

### Player IPC Channels (14 total)
```typescript
// Control Commands
'get-player-state'           // Get current playback state
'player-play'               // Play track (with queue option)
'player-pause'              // Pause playback
'player-resume'             // Resume playback  
'player-stop'               // Stop playback
'player-seek'               // Seek to time position
'player-set-volume'         // Set volume (0-1)

// Navigation Commands  
'player-next'               // Play next track
'player-previous'           // Play previous track

// Queue Management
'player-add-to-queue'       // Add track to queue
'player-remove-from-queue'  // Remove track from queue
