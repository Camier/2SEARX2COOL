## ✅ Key Features Delivered

### 📊 Scoring Algorithm
- **Multi-factor scoring** combining:
  - Play count (30% weight) - Logarithmic scale

  - Completion rate (10% weight) - Average play percentage
- **Special modifiers**:
  - Favorite boost: 2x multiplier
  - Skip penalty: Reduces score based on skip ratio
  - Score range: 0-100 normalized

### 🎯 User Interaction Tracking
- **Play Events**: Duration, percentage completed, context
- **Skip Detection**: Tracks < 50% completion as skips
- **Ratings**: 1-5 star system with update tracking
- **Favorites**: Quick toggle with immediate score boost
- **Search Interactions**: Click, play, download tracking

### 🔍 Personalized Search
- **Hybrid Ranking**: Blends relevance score with personal score
- **Configurable Weights**: Default 70% relevance, 30% personal
- **Favorite Priority**: Favorites always rank higher
- **Result Enhancement**: Adds personal metadata to results
- **Session Tracking**: Groups interactions by search session

### 🎨 UI Components

  - Demonstrates maximum engagement
- **Track 4 Example**:
  - 1 play (skip) + 2★ rating = 8.4/100 score
  - Shows penalty for poor engagement

### Ranking Results

## 🔄 Data Flow

```
User Action → PersonalScoreService
    ├── Record Event (play/rate/favorite)
    ├── Update Statistics (triggers)
    ├── Calculate Score (algorithm)
    └── Apply to Search (ranking)
```

## 📋 Implementation Details

### Score Calculation
```javascript
score = (playScore * 0.3) + 
        (ratingScore * 0.4) + 
        (recencyScore * 0.2) + 
        (completionScore * 0.1)

if (favorite) score *= 2.0
if (skips > 0) score *= (1 - skipRatio * 0.5)
```

### Search Enhancement
```javascript
finalScore = (relevanceScore * 0.7) + 
             (personalScore * 0.3)

if (favorite) finalScore *= 1.5
```

## 🎨 UI Component Examples

### Rating Stars
