# 📚 Week 4 Day 3: Library Browser & Management

## 🎯 Objectives
Build a comprehensive library browsing interface with advanced filtering, sorting, and management capabilities.

## 📋 Implementation Tasks

### 1. Core Components
- [ ] **LibraryBrowser.tsx** - Main container component
- [ ] **LibraryGrid.tsx** - Grid view with album art
- [ ] **LibraryList.tsx** - Detailed list view
- [ ] **LibraryFilters.tsx** - Genre/Year/Rating filters
- [ ] **LibrarySorter.tsx** - Sort controls
- [ ] **AlbumArtwork.tsx** - Image component with fallback

### 2. Database Integration
- [ ] Create library query methods
- [ ] Implement pagination for large libraries
- [ ] Add filtering SQL queries
- [ ] Optimize with proper indexes

### 3. Features
- [ ] View toggle (Grid/List)
- [ ] Multi-select for batch operations
- [ ] Right-click context menu
- [ ] Keyboard navigation
- [ ] Virtual scrolling for performance
- [ ] Drag to player/queue

### 4. IPC Channels
```typescript
'library-get-tracks'      // Get paginated tracks
'library-get-albums'      // Get albums view
'library-get-artists'     // Get artists view
'library-filter'          // Apply filters
'library-sort'            // Apply sorting
'library-batch-update'    // Batch operations
```

## 🎨 UI Design
- Material Design inspired cards
- Smooth animations
- Hover effects
- Loading skeletons
- Empty states
- Error handling

## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash
# Create component structure
mkdir -p src/renderer/components/library
touch src/renderer/components/library/LibraryBrowser.tsx
touch src/main/services/LibraryService.ts
touch src/main/ipc/libraryHandlers.ts
```

## ⏱️ Time Estimate
- Components: 3-4 hours
- Service & IPC: 2 hours  
- Testing & Polish: 1-2 hours
- **Total**: 6-8 hours
