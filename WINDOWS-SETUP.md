# 🪟 Windows Setup Guide - Quick Fix

## 🎯 Issue: `naudiodon` package not available on Windows

The `naudiodon` package is a Linux-specific audio library that doesn't work on Windows. Here's how to fix it:

## **Option 1: Skip Optional Dependencies (RECOMMENDED)**

```powershell
# In Windows PowerShell:
cd C:\Users\micka\Documents\
git clone https://github.com/Camier/2SEARX2COOL.git
cd 2SEARX2COOL
git checkout refactor/complete-implementation

# Install with optional dependencies disabled
npm install --ignore-optional

# Start the application
npm run dev
```

## **Option 2: Remove problematic dependency manually**

If Option 1 doesn't work:

```powershell
# Edit package.json and remove the "usb" line from optionalDependencies
# Then:
npm install
npm run dev
```

## **Expected Result:**
- ✅ Electron window opens properly
- ✅ Music player interface loads
- ✅ MIDI features disabled (but music player works perfectly)
- ✅ All core functionality available

## **Features Available on Windows:**
- ✅ Music search and playback
- ✅ Queue management  
- ✅ Personal scoring system
- ✅ Library browser
- ❌ MIDI hardware integration (Windows incompatible)

The music player will work perfectly - you just won't have MIDI controller support, which isn't essential for testing the core features we built!

## **Verification:**
After `npm run dev`, you should see:
1. Electron window opens
2. Search interface loads
3. Music player at bottom
4. Queue panel available
5. All UI components working

**Try Option 1 first - it should resolve the Windows compatibility issue!** 🚀
