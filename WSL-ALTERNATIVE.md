# üêß WSL Alternative - Virtual Display Setup

## The WSL Issue

WSL lacks proper GPU/display integration for complex Electron apps. The errors you saw:
- `GPU process launch failed: error_code=1002`
- `GPU process isn't usable. Goodbye.`

Are fundamental WSL limitations that can't be easily fixed.

## **Alternative: Test the Backend Only**

Since the UI won't work reliably in WSL, let's test the core services:

### **Option 1: Test Music Player Logic**
```bash
# In WSL - Test the core functionality
cd ~/SEARXNG/2SEARX2COOL-FINAL-INTEGRATED

# Run the test suite we created
node test-music-player.js

# Test specific services
node src/main/services/test-personal-scoring.js
node src/main/services/test-offline-mode.js
```

### **Option 2: API Testing**
```bash
# Test SearXNG integration
curl http://localhost:8888/search?q=test

# Test database connectivity
npm run test:unit
```

### **Option 3: Windows Development (RECOMMENDED)**

Use Windows for UI development, WSL for backend:

1. **Windows**: Full Electron app development
2. **WSL**: SearXNG server, database, backend services
3. **VS Code**: Remote WSL extension to edit WSL files from Windows

## **Bottom Line:**

The **Windows setup** is your best bet for seeing the music player UI we built. The backend logic works perfectly in WSL, but Electron + WSL = compatibility nightmare.

**Try the Windows setup first with `--ignore-optional` flag!** üöÄ
